-- This script creates three views in the gold layer to support reporting and analysis:
-- 1. gold.dim_customers: A customer dimension view that combines CRM customer info with ERP demographic and location data. It enriches gender and birthdate fields and assigns surrogate keys.
-- 2. gold.dim_products: A product dimension view integrating CRM product info with ERP category details. It filters out inactive products and assigns surrogate keys based on product start date and key.
-- 3. gold.fact_sales: A sales fact view that combines CRM sales transactions with the gold-layer product and customer dimensions, enabling dimensional analysis by product and customer attributes.
